                    RU Hacks is a unique hackathon at Ryerson University.
                    Hackers meet new people, learn new skills and have fun while
                    showcasing their talents over the course of 48 hours of
                    creativity and innovation.

                    For those of you who may not know; a hackathon is an event
                    where programmers in teams collaborate on a project to solve
                    a problem. As was done for the previous year, this
                    year&apos;s hackathon will be completely virtual. We will
                    run the opening and closing ceremonies, events, workshops
                    and activities over a livestream. We will be using Hopin for
                    the livestream, Devpost for project submission and Discord
                    to allow for easy communication with hackers, organizers,
                    mentors and more. Head over to the Hacker Guide for more
                    information on how the server has been organized and how you
                    can interact with everyone involved in the event!
