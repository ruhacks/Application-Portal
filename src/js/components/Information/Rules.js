                        Racism, Sexism and Harassment is not tolerated on this
                        server. We uphold an environment of respect. Do not
                        demoralize another person’s racial status of sexual
                        orientation, with intent outside of context, to cause
                        emotional distress. Verbal harassment is harmful and we
                        ask that you avoid this behavior at all times.
