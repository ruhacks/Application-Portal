                their project during the hackathon. However, you are welcome to

                closer to the hackathon. The top projects will get a chance to

                will be released closer to the hackathon.

                We will also be using Kumospace for networking events, which is

                considered for our grand prizes regardless of what you end up
                building. We are not unveiling too much information regarding
                our categories, sponsored hacks, and prizes in advance to

                <br></br>We&apos;ll have many technical workshops ranging from
                data analytics to web dev, and even if you are a new hacker
                without much coding experience, there&apos;ll be plenty to learn
                about UX, accessibility, and staying in demand in 2021.
                Additionally, free #》resources will become available closer to
