                projects. RU Hacks hackers are required to start and complete
                their project during the hackathon. However, you are welcome to
                familiarize yourself with specific tools and technologies
                beforehand!

                fields. More specific judging criteria will be sent to you
                closer to the hackathon. The top projects will get a chance to
                show their recorded demos in front of all of RU Hacks during the
                closing ceremony.

                You are welcome to create a hardware hack, but we ask that you
                respect COVID-19 restrictions while doing so. More information
                will be released closer to the hackathon.

                join our Team Formation session at the start of the hackathon on

                events, which is a drop-in, drop-out event platform. Don&apos;t
                worry - no need to set anything up for this one.

                considered for our grand prizes regardless of what you end up
                building. We are not unveiling too much information regarding
                our categories, sponsored hacks, and prizes in advance to
                discourage hackers from starting ahead of the event.

                weekend.
                <br></br>We&apos;ll have many technical workshops ranging from
                data analytics to web dev, and even if you are a new hacker
                without much coding experience, there&apos;ll be plenty to learn
                about UX, accessibility, and staying in demand in 2021.
                Additionally, free resources (which you can find in #resources)
                will become available closer to the start of the event.
