# Application Portal

Our Application Portal for 2021

This is our application portal at https://app.ruhacks.com to handle our entire hacker application process and hacker management including:

-   Handle our entire hacker application process including submissions of applications and confirmations
-   Handle an OAuth login to connect users with their Discord accounts so when a user is admitted/confirmed and they join our main discord server weâ€™ll be able to automatically detect who has joined and assign a role to them as a hacker along with their actual name as their nickname and pronouns as a secondary role.
-   Handle basic user requests such as login, forgot password and registration
-   Create an entire experience for administrators and organizers that shows off application & user statistics, viewing user applications and admitting and rejecting of users

Application questions are fully customizable in src/js/config/defaultState.js along with a set of restrictions you can set in place based on the field
